Have you ever stopped to think about how many websites you visit per day? There are more than 1 billion websites scattered across the web. Imagine how difficult it would be to memorize the web addresses of every site you visit? And what about discovering new sites? To tackle these problems, web search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and others were created. But how do these search engines analyze all the websites and determine which ones should be more relevant to you? All of this is done through an algorithm called PageRank.

üöÄ PageRank is an algorithm developed by Google with the purpose of ranking web pages based on their importance. It checks (in addition to internal page elements) the quantity and quality of links that the page has, helping to give greater relevance and certainty to search results.
